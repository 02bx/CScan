#Description\
project description：The web crawler-based vulnerability detection system mainly uses the web crawler to use C#'s visual simple programming and powerful core library and third-party developed control framework to develop a set of system which can scan and analyze bugs, then release scanning report and fixing suggestions. Through testing and trialing operation, the system can meet the needs of users, and has the advantages of simplifying the penetration testing process workflow, saving manpower and material input of penetration testing, convenient use, and high vulnerability scanning accuracy.\
项目描述：基于网络爬虫的漏洞检测系统，主要使用网络爬虫利用C#的可视化简便编程和强大的核心库以及第三方开发的控件框架，开发出一套可以对漏洞进行扫描、分析进而得出扫描报告以及给出修复建议的系统。通过测试与试运行，该系统能够满足用户的需求，具备简化渗透测试流程工作流程，节约渗透测试的人力物力的投入，使用方便，有较高的漏洞扫描准确率等优点。\
